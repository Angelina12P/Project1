# Project1 (unique name)

## Description 
The design of this _interactive webpage_ was based around art from different centuries using the MSI API and keys and based upon the choice of preference to find out more about it through a link that directed the user to a relevant book. 

This challenge required the construction of a webpage using our knowledge (learnt so far) of HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript and JSON commands. The use of API and API keys as the main focus of the website was employed. 

The other aspect of this challenge - equally as important - was to adopt a multidisciplinary approach harnessing the best individual skills of each person to design and execute a webpage/site fit for purpose

The major issues encountered during the construction and implementation of the webpage included:

* addressing a method(s) to resolve artwork where images were not stored/present within the API 

* using the most appropriate elements and structures (e.g. header design, image and text cards). As a group we felt that the best approach in the interests of time was to use Bootstrap which required a link within HTML to permit its use

* using fetch and .then to access objects from the API to ensure that the user was able to access the required information about the artwork of interest

* using appropriate commands in CSS to ensure the webpage was designed/"clothed" appropriately on top of the basic HTML skeleton


## Technologies used

* VS code v.1.75.1
* Bootstrap v.1.4.3.1
* Sigma wireframing software
* Youtube to obtain information for assisting in the design and successful syntax commands for the webpage
* GitHub to create a repo for the webpage project and then individual user branches to permit coding with a view to merging into the main branch after review
* Zoom virtual meeting rooms to discuss the project, type the coding syntax in realtime

## Installation

* Creating  a demo webpage on "Github Pages" 

## Intended use

* The webpage was designed to be used by novice and experienced individuals who have an interest in art and wish to find out more about the art seen on the page

Project Idea (2 or 3 sentences)

we will create an app that adds suggested reading based on the art that the user chooses. It will show random art until the user chooses one and then it will suggest reading for further info.
